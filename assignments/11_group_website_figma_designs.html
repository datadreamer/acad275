            Now that your groups have been set, your first step is for your group to meet, if necessary revisit the core focus/purpose of the site, and then write up a proposal. Then try out three frontpage designs, in preparation for building out the pages of the site (the Content Build). You will need to submit a few different deliverables:<br>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Proposal: This is a written proposal for the project. Your group will all discuss/have input even if one person writes the draft. It needs to include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mission: Description of the mission and scope of the site.</li>
                        <li>Audience/s: List out at least three distinct audiences/personas for your site, noting which is the primary one. This should obviously draw from your user research.</li>
                        <li>Features: What "features" will the site have, such as interactive maps, shopping carts, customizable content, etc. You can revisit this after the technical requirements are announced. But this can be a generic "wishlist" of site features (even if some are not realistic).</li>
                        <li>Team roles: Initial thoughts on team roles, such as Project Manager, Lead Designer, HTML and CSS production, Javascript developer, Q/A, etc. Obviously in such small groups many of you will have more than one role and multiple people may have the same roles.</li>
                        <li>Site map: Preferably rendered and not hand-drawn.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Three Frontpage designs: A minimum of three mock-ups of the frontpage for the site created in Figma.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            Each group can decide on how to divide up the labor. I.e. each person could come up with one design, or one person could come up with three. One person will probably take primary responsibility for writing the proposal, but all should contribute. With the Content Build due soon after, we will not have much time to critique the three variations, but creating three versions should give the team an opportunity to evaluate a couple different design approaches/options.<br>

            <i>Upload your completed assignment by the due date specified above and make sure that you add a working link to it on your class page, otherwise it will not be reviewed and you will not receive credit. If you expect to be late submitting an assignment, you need to email the instructor and grader prior to the deadline to notify them of the late submission, then later follow up once your assignment has been completed, uploaded, and linked from your class page. The latest a late assignment can be submitted is a week after its original due date.</i><br><br>
