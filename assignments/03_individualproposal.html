            Create a page that will act as a digital presentation of your individual website proposal. Your website can be on any topic (a business, a tv show, a band, an activity, a club, your dog, a vacation, or a portfolio site among other ideas). Your proposal must include:
            <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>A graphically rendered site map showing navigation between pages.</li>
                <li>A section on the mission of the site.</li>
                <li>A section on the audience for the site.</li>
                <li>A section on content for the site.</li>
                <li>A section on graphics for the site.</li>
                <li>Notes on overall design and style of the site. Including sketches or moodboards would be very useful.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <i>Upload your completed assignment by the due date specified above and make sure that you add a working link to it on your class page, otherwise it will not be reviewed and you will not receive credit. If you expect to be late submitting an assignment, you need to email the instructor and grader prior to the deadline to notify them of the late submission, then later follow up once your assignment has been completed, uploaded, and linked from your class page. The latest a late assignment can be submitted is a week after its original due date.</i><br><br>
