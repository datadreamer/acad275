            Take Assignment #02 - Film Article Package Layout and use the jQuery JavaScript library to add interaction to various elements within the page. These should be reactions to click, mouseover, or mouseout events. They can vary from revealing/hiding content to changing colors of things to changing attributes.<br>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>When you mouseover an image, have it swap to an alternate image. When you mouseout, have it swap back to the original.</li>
                <li>When you mouseover a text information box, swap out the background color. When you mouseout, have it swap back to the original.</li>
                <li>When you click on a film section, it collapses down to just the headline. When you click it again, it expands to show everything.</li> 
            </ul>
