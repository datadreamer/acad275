            <h1>Group Website Topic Pitch</h1>
            <h3>DUE: Tuesday, 3/7 @ 5pm</h3>
            <br><br>

            The final assignment for the class is a group website project that students will work on together in teams of 3-4 people. Each student must write an initial proposal for a potential website idea, as well as record a one-minute pitch video to be embedded in their pitch page. All students will be voting on their top 3 most desired website ideas to be a part of, and the most popular ones will go forward to the final presentations.<br>
            <br>
            
            The site idea scope must include four elements (write a paragraph or so for each):
            <ul>
                <li><b>Problem/Need</b>: What is the problem or need the site is addressing?</li>
                <li><b>Solution</b>: How will the website solve the problem, address the need, etc?</li>
                <li><b>Analysis</b>: What is currently in that space? These could be existing solutions, potential competitors, etc.</li>
                <li><b>Impact and Vision</b>: Skipping forward 5 years, what change or impact do you hope the site will have made? What is your vision for how it could make a difference?</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            Here are some things your site will not be able to do as it's outside the scope of the class:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Save user data</b>: We won't be able to allow users to post to your website, as we will not be doing any server side scripting or database work in this class.</li>
                <li><b>Multi-user interaction</b>: Live data transmission is outside the scope of this course.</li>
                <li><b>E-commerce</b>: You can set up an order form, but won't be able to process transactions.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
