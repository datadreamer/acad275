            <ul>
                <li><b>Purpose:</b> The web site is expected to fulfill the general goals and purpose that you defined in your project proposal.</li>
                <li><b>External Stylesheet:</b> Sites must use an external stylesheet for shared/global styles/formatting, although you can also use internal styles and additional (page-specific) stylesheets.</li>
                <li><b>Responsive Web Design:</b> Pages should be at least broadly adaptable, and at a minimum should work on both laptops and phones.</li>
                <li><b>Extras:</b> The pages should feature some non-basic techologies from the middle part of the course that add interactivity, deepen the content or web experience, etc., from advanced media queries to css hover and trasitions to basic jQuery (or JS) interactions and plug-ins (photo galleries and other interactive page elements). Here's a partial list of some technologies:
                    <br><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>CSS-based drop-down menus.</li>
                        <li>CSS transitions (:hover or jQuery-triggered).</li>
                        <li>Embedded web video and/or audio.</li>
                        <li>More detailed/intricate adaptive layouts/media queries.</li>
                        <li>jQuery or JavaScript elements.</li>
                        <li>jQuery or JavaScript plug-ins such as photo galleries, interactive menus, etc.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                </li>
                <li>Projects will be graded according to many of the same general parameters from the project proposals. These include organization, graphics and navigation, implementation of project goal, general amount and quality of site content, and complexity of HTML and CSS.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
