            <h1>Calculator Web App</h1>
            <h3>DUE: Tuesday, 2/28 @ 5pm</h3>
            <br><br>

            You will be making a basic four-function web-based calculator.<br>
            <br>
            <a href="calculator_template.html">Save the startpage to your computer</a>. Notice that this file ALREADY has some functions and variables defined in it. These should help to give some structure and hints to help you start.<br>
            <br>
            Basic workflow of this page is that a person enters a number by clicking the buttons with their cursor, then presses a math function, then enters a second number, then presses the equal sign, and the result appears.<br>
            <br>

            <b>Requirements:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Create a visual identity for the app (colors, typography, styles, etc)</li>
                <li>Design the appearance of the calculator buttons.</li>
                <li>When the user presses a numeric button, the number is added to the input field.</li>
                <li>When the user presses a math button, the first number is stored, the math operation is stores, and the input screen is cleared.</li>
                <li>When the user presses the equal button, the current number is stored, the app checks to make sure the user previously entered a first number and a math operation, and then performs the appropriate calculation, outputs the result to the text box, and clears the variables.</li>
                <li>If the user presses the clear button, the variables are all cleared and the input box is cleared.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
