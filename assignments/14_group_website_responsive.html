            Your site and pages should adapt to different device/screen sizes. At a minimum layouts and page elements should shift from a larger screen, such as your laptop or desktop monitor, to a smaller screen/resolution, such as a phone. Or more simply put, whatever your core design (mobile first or large format) your site must adapt.<br>

            <i>Upload your completed assignment by the due date specified above and make sure that you add a working link to it on your class page, otherwise it will not be reviewed and you will not receive credit. If you expect to be late submitting an assignment, you need to email the instructor and grader prior to the deadline to notify them of the late submission, then later follow up once your assignment has been completed, uploaded, and linked from your class page. The latest a late assignment can be submitted is a week after its original due date.</i><br><br>
