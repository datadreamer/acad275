            <h1>Frontpage Design Notes</h1>
            <h3>DUE: Tuesday, 2/14 @ 5pm</h3>
            <br><br>

            Go to our class Piazza page and to the discussion thread "Assignment: Frontpage critiques". On that thread create a post under "Start a new follow-up discussion". Post information about your project and frontpage, including URL, notes on the intended site and design notes (see the "sample" post on the thread for more details).<br>
            <br>

            <ul>
                <li>Start your thread with the title/topic of your project along with a link to a "steady" build of the frontpage URL.</li>
                <li>In the rest of the thread explain:
                    <ul>
                        <li>the purpose, audience and content for the intended overall site.</li>
                        <li>your design choices.</li>
                        
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Give enough detail so your peers understand enough about your goals and assumptions to critique your frontpages.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            Please note you need to post this <b>on time</b> so that selected peers can post replies in your follow-up sub-thread with their critiques.<br>
            <br>

            If this is not posted on time your group peers will be asked to post their critiques on a thread for you created by the TAS or instructor, without your design notes, and your homepage will be open to criticism without any consideration of your intentions, thoughts, etc.<br>
            <br>
