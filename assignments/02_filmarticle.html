            Create a film article package that will showcase your ability to create a web layout to convey informational content. Follow the page requirements below:<br>
            <br>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Establish a theme for your film selection (sci-fi, 90s, superhero, etc).</li>
                <li>Create an original graphic to use for the top of your webpage.</li>
                <li>A paragraph introduction that you write to describe the selection of films.</li>
                <li>Four sections, one for each film article, all using different foreground and background colors. Each film article must contain:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Headline.</li>
                        <li>Article text: including paragraph breaks as necessary.</li>
                        <li>Image: wrapped as floats within the container.</li>
                        <li>Text Information Box: additional information about the film like cast and crew, also wrapped as a float within the container.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            Upload your completed assignment by the due date specified above and make sure that you add a working link to it on your class page, otherwise it will not be reviewed and you will not receive credit. If you expect to be late submitting an assignment, you need to email the instructor and grader prior to the deadline to notify them of the late submission, then later follow up once your assignment has been completed, uploaded, and linked from your class page. The latest a late assignment can be submitted is a week after its origin due date.<br><br>
