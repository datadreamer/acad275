            Visit the class Piazza page and locate the thread for frontpage critiques, then find the posts from the three students who you have been assigned to review. Read their post, visit their webpage, and reply to their post with constructive criticism based on the criteria outlined in the critique presentation. Each critique should contain positive and negative elements. You should be giving constructive feedback. You are expected to give at least three positive reinforcements about elements you like and think they should keep/build on and at least three suggestions for improvement.<br>
