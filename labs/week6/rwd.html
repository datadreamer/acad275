            Create a webpage that uses responsive web design techniques, either using percentage based fluid layouts or using flexbox techniques, as well as media queries to allow for the layout to adjust to different dimensions, creating a desktop layout and a mobile layout. The page can be about any subject matter you choose and use any content you derive from wherever you like (do try to keep it class appropriate). The page must have the following criteria:<br>
            <br>

            <ul>
                <li>The page must fill the entire browser width, with no margins around the body.</li>
                <li>The page must have a header area that spans the full width of the browser with a title of some type inside it.</li>
                <li>The page must have a sidebar on the left or right that has a fixed width.</li>
                <li>The page must have a main content area with a variable width that adjusts with browser dimensions.</li>
                <li>The main content area must have a gallery of thumbnail images that wrap when the browser width is adjusted.</li>
                <li>The page must have a footer area that spans the full width of the browser.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
