            Create a web page with a minimum of 10 different divs, all of them set to float, in order to see how they re-arrange while adjusting the browser width. The divs can be varying widths and heights, and make sure you style the divs with different background colors and foreground colors to create some obvious visual differentiation between them.<br>
            <br>
            <i>Upload your completed lab by the due date specified above and make sure that you add a working link to it on your class page, otherwise it will not be reviewed and you will not receive credit.</i><br><br>
