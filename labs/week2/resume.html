            Create an online resume to showcase yourself for potential employers. Your resume must include the following content and formatting criteria:<br>
            <br>

            <ul>
                <li>You must have a top section that contains the following content:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your name and <b>FAKE</b> contact information like phone numbers, email, and home address.</li>
                        <li>A picture of yourself (or an image you want to represent you) aligned to float left or right.</li><br>

                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The resume must have three informational sections:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Education: your current university, degree program, minors, and expected graduation date.</li>
                        <li>Work Experience: any internships or jobs you have had previously.</li>
                        <li>Skills: any hard or soft skills that would be useful for an employer to know about.</li><br>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Your content should be nicely styled so that all of your sections are clearly identified as separate, and that you are using font size, style, color, and background-color to indicate the organization of content.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
