            <h1>Text Formatted Article</h1>
            <h3>DUE: Thursday, 2/2 @ 5pm</h3>
            <br><br>

            Pick an article from the web between 500 and 1500 words and use the content as the basis for this lab. You will copy the content and restyle it using your own selection of HTML tags and application of CSS styles. Consider how the nature of the content will determine the theme and style you apply to the page. Make sure to copy the logo from the original article and incorporate that into your page redesign.<br>
            <br>
            Find additional images related to the article to incorporate into your page design. Find additional information that you can incorporate into the article layout. You will need to incorporate the following design features into your page:<br>
            <br>

            <ul>
                <li><b>H1-H6</b>: use the header tags <span class="code">h1</span> - <span class="code">h6</span> as well as <span class="code">p</span>, <span class="code">span</span>, and <span class="code">br</span> to style the different text elements in your article appropriately.</li>
                <li><b>Font</b>: use a non-standard webfont that you have incorporated into your CSS. Make sure there are fallback options if the webfont can't be loaded by the browser.</li>
                <li><b>RGBA</b>: use rgba() for all of the colors in your styles. Find a meaningful use for reduced alpha at least once somewhere in your page.</li>
                <li><b>CSS Visual Styles</b>: incorporate rounded corners, box-shadow, and text-shadow at least once each.</li>
                <li><b>Columns</b>: incorporate text-columns somewhere in your article design so that you have a block element that splits the text into at least two distinct columns.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            Once complete, make note of any compatibility issues that you encounter across browsers or across devices (how does the design look on your phone compared to your laptop). Add those notes to the bottom of your page.<br>
            <br>

            <i>Upload your completed lab by the due date specified above and make sure that you add a working link to it on your class page, otherwise it will not be reviewed and you will not receive credit.</i><br>
