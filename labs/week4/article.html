            <h1>Text Formatted Article</h1>
            <h3>DUE: Thursday, 2/2 @ 5pm</h3>
            <br><br>

            Pick an article from the web between 500 and 1500 words and use the content as the basis for this lab. You will copy the content and restyle it using your own selection of HTML tags and application of CSS styles. Consider how the nature of the content will determine the theme and style you apply to the page. Make sure to copy the logo from the original article and incorporate that into your page redesign.<br>
            <br>
            Find additional images related to the article to incorporate into your page design. Find additional information that you can incorporate into the article layout. You will need to incorporate the following design features into your page:<br>
            <br>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Font</b>: use a non-standard webfont that you have incorporated into your CSS.</li>
                <li><b>RGBA</b>: use rgba() for all of the colors in your styles. Find a meaningful use for reduced alpha at least once somewhere in your page.</li>
                <li><b>Columns</b>: incorporate text-columns somewhere in your article design.</li>
                <li><b>Sidebar</b>: create a sidebar that uses the position property to overlap the main article, uses opacity to makes it mostly transparent by default, and uses a transition to become fully opaque when the mouse hovers over it.</li>
                <li><b>Multiple Background Images</b>: set one div to use multiple overlapping background images.</li>
                <li><b>Miscelanious Transitions</b>: apply hover event transitions to various elements in your article design.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            Once complete, make note of any compatibility issues that you encounter across browsers or across devices (how does the design look on your phone compared to your laptop). Add those notes to the bottom of your page.<br>
            <br>
