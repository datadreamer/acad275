            You will be creating a page that has two different behaviors depending on the state of a cookie being set. When the user visits the page without the cookie being set, it will behave as a login page. When the user visits the page after the cookie has been set, it will behave as a welcome page.<br>
            <br>

            The <b>login</b> version of the page must contain:
            <ol>
                <li>A text input field for "username".</li>
                <li>A password input field for "password".</li>
                <li>A submit button.</li>
                <li>A blue background (any shade).</li>
            </ol>
            <br>

            When the user enters their information and hits the submit button, a JavaScript event should be triggered which:

            <ol>
                <li>Saves the username to a cookie called "username".</li>
                <li>Checks to see if the password is correct (this should just be a hardcoded string in your JavaScript).</li>
                <li>If the password is correct, set a cookie called "login" to "true".</li>
                <li>If the password is incorrect, set a cookie called "login" to "false".</li>
                <li>The page refreshes.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>

            The <b>welcome</b> version of the page must contain:
            <ul>
                <li>If the "login" cookie is "true":
                    <ol>
                        <li>A green background (any shade).</li>
                        <li>A positive message welcoming them to the site.</li>
                        <li>A logout button, that when pressed will:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Clear the cookies for the site.</li>
                                <li>Refresh the page returning the user to its login state.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>If the "login" cookie is false:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Redisplay the login page.</li>
                        <li>This time with an error message at the top saying access denied.</li>
                        <li>Have a red background (any shade).</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>
