            Create a survey form on a topic of your choice. This can be about entertainment, hobbies, politics, social movements... get creative! <i>(Note: The survey does not need to be functional, as in it doesn't need to be able to submit and save user entered information to the server, as that is outside the scope of this course.)</i> Derive a logo or main image about your topic and use that to create a color and typography scheme for the styles of your survey page, and incorporate that image into the top of your page.<br>
            <br>
            Your survey form must make use of each of the following basic input objects at least once each:
            <ul>
                <li>Text Input</li>
                <li>Radio Buttons</li>
                <li>Checkbox</li>
                <li>Textarea</li>
                <li>Select menu</li>
                <li>Submit and Reset buttons</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            Your form must also make use of <b>three</b> of the following HTML5 input objects:
            <ul>
                <li>email, url, or tel</li>
                <li>color</li>
                <li>date or datetime</li>
                <li>number</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            Your form must also make use of all <b>four</b> of the following HTML5 attributes at least once each:
            <ul>
                <li>placeholder</li>
                <li>required</li>
                <li>title</li>
                <li>autofocus</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
