            <br><br>

            Visit this <a href="https://forms.gle/31ENRAgfBoF8FCbV6">google form</a> and fill out your preference for top 3 projects you would like to get involved with (do not pick yourself, as we will assume that your own idea is your top choice). Please make sure you complete this before midnight tonight so that I have time to review the responses tomorrow and form the most effective groups around the top 3 ideas.<br>
            <br>

            <i>Upload your completed lab by the due date specified above and make sure that you add a working link to it on your class page, otherwise it will not be reviewed and you will not receive credit.</i><br>
