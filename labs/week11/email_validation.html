            <ul>
                <li>Create a form page that asks someone to fill in their email address into a text box. The page should have a form, a text input field, and a button that says "Validate email".</li>
                <li>When the user presses the "Validate email" button, it should execute a JavaScript routine that checks the value of the text input field to make sure the data has both an at (@) character and a period (.) character, and that the period comes after the @ in the string.</li>
                <li>If the email address is valid, it should trigger an alert that says "Email address is valid", if not it should trigger an alert that says "Please enter a valid email address".</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
