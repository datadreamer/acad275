            <h1>User Created Object Instances</h1>

            Create a page that allows a user to input property values and create new instances of a class. Print results to the screen. You will need to design a class to hold data about a subject of your choosing that has a minimum of 5 different properties.<br>
            <br>

            Your page should have:
            <ol>
                <li>Five (5) text input fields to allow the user to create a new class instance (so if we are doing dogs we could have breed, name, weight, color, and age).</li>
                <li>A drop-down menu listing the properties of your custom class, allowing the user to select what to sort by.</li>
                <li>A submit button to save newly entered data as a new class instance within an array.</li>
                <li>An empty div to which you will write the results with the id "results".</li>
            </ol>
            <br>

            When the submit button has been pressed, the behavior of your JavaScript should:
            <ul>
                <li>Create a new class instance (an object) using the values entered by the user.</li>
                <li>Store the class instance in an array.</li>
                <li>Sort the array based on the property that the user selected from the drop-down (or the default value).</li>
                <li>Loop over the array and write the object data out to the page.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            When the user changes the property to sort on from the drop-down menu, it should trigger a "change" event and re-sort the array and print them out to the page replacing any previous results.<br>
            <br>
