            <ul>
                <li>Create a page about a hobby or interest you have with a two column layout: a sidebar (left or right) and the main section.</li>
                <li>The main section should describe some of your hobbies and contain at least two headlines, five paragraphs of text, and two or more images.</li>
                <li>The sidebar should also contain two sections:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The sections should be labeled "Text" and "Background".</li>
                        <li>Each section should have 10 radio buttons with different colors.</li>
                        <li>Users should be able to select only one radio button per column at a time.</li>
                        <li>In a script block, write vanilla JavaScript (no jQuery) that binds a listener to each radio button for the click event, and then changes the content div to the corresponding background or text color.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>A "reset" button near the color selections that resets the pages colors to their starting values.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
