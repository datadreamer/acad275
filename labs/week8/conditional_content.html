            <ul>
                <li>Pick a TV show and edit the introductory text to indicate the show. You will need to create three drop-down menus in a form with the following criteria:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Identify three characters from the show and add them to a drop-down list of characters. Get three images, one for each character.</li>
                        <li>Get at least three episode names and add them to another drop-down list of episodes. Find or make some text that acts as a synopsis for each episode.</li>
                        <li>Come up with three moods that you think embody the theme of the show, and add them to a drop-down list.</li>
                        <li>Add a submit button to the form with the text value "Generate".</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <br>

                <li>In JavaScript you're going to want to create a function that processes the selections from the three drop-down lists and makes the appropriate changes to the page using a series of if statements:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Evaluate the drop-down list for the character selected and change the image and character name accordingly.</li>
                        <li>Evaluate the drop-down list for the mood selected and change the text color and background color accordingly.</li>
                        <li>Evaluate the drop-down list for the episode selected and change out the description of the episode below the character image and name.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
