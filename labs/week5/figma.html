            Create a simple mockup of your individual website frontpage in a Figma design project. Include your layout, navigation, major sections, visual identity, typography, and any images you plan to incorporate. Make your design as close to what you hope to accomplish as possible. You will be able to use the CSS from Figma to inform how to style your HTML elements when you build your actual page.<br>
            <br>

            <i>Upload your completed lab by the due date specified above and make sure that you add a working link to it on your class page, otherwise it will not be reviewed and you will not receive credit.</i><br>
