            <br/><br/>

            <ul>
                <li> The written exam might ask questions about any/all html and css concepts we have studies. The practical exam, by its nature, will not of course cover/require every concept we have studied.</li>
                <li> You will need to know how to USE styles but will not have to memorize particular style properties (font-size, background-color, etc.). Both exams will have partial lists of style property names where needed.</li>
                <li> For the practical exam you can pretty much any text or html editor such as Visual Studio Code, Atom, Brackets, TextWrangler, Sublime Edit, Notepad, Notepad+, TextEdit, etc. You WILL of course also be allowed to have a web browser open to test your pages.</li>
            </ul>
